# CEP Query in C#

### Program made in .NET Core.

This program was made in .NET Core, using the Refit package, present in the NuGet package manager, in order to apply knowledge on API's consumption. The program consumes the data from the '[brazilapi](https://brasilapi.com.br/)' API, and returns it to the user in a simple way. 

**Still in development**
